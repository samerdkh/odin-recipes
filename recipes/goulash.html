              COOKING:
              Step 1
              In a large skillet over medium heat, heat oil. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 7 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute more.
              Step 2
              Add ground beef, season with salt and pepper, and cook, breaking up with a spoon, until no longer pink, about 6 minutes. Drain fat.
              Step 3
              Add tomato paste and stir to coat, then pour in diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, and broth. Add Italian seasoning and paprika, then stir in macaroni. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until pasta is tender, 10-15 minutes.
              Step 4
              Stir in cheese until melted; season with salt and pepper, if needed. Remove from heat. Top with parsley.
