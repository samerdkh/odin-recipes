      COOKING:
      Step 1
      In a large pot over medium-high heat, cook ground beef, onion, and garlic, stirring occasionally, until beef is browned, 5 to 6 minutes. Add water, tomatoes, and taco seasoning, then cover and bring to a boil.
      Step 2
      Break spaghetti in half lengthwise and add to sauce. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and simmer until pasta is tender, 12 to 14 minutes.
      Step 3
      Remove from heat and stir in Velveeta, cheddar, and cilantro until cheese is melted. Serve topped with more cilantro and sour cream, if using.
